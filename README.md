# Project:Medicinal Herb Collection 
# Introduction

This project explores an interactive experience where players gather medicinal herbs, unlock recipes, and create medicines. The emphasis is on discovery, awareness, and purposeful exploration rather than competitive scoring. The game’s central mechanic revolves around a collection system that encourages players to learn about both beneficial and harmful properties of herbs in an immersive environment.

# Objectives
1. Create Medicine: Recipes enable the crafting of medicines to cure symptoms or conditions that appear during exploration.
2.  Collection System: The primary goal is to collect herbs, knowledge, and recipes.

# We will keep the tools
1. 3D Map: A dynamic world where exploration takes place (forests, meadows, riversides).
2. Herbs Collection: A growing library of plant models with distinct traits, textures, and effects (list to be developed).
3. Materials & Textures: Naturalistic assets for plants, terrain, and crafted medicine.

# Scripts and Components
1. Grabbing Mechanic: Players can pick and store plants directly from the environment.

# How you will gain experience from project

The project aims to deliver a reflective and educational exploration experience, balancing curiosity, strategy, and awareness. By avoiding score-based progression and instead focusing on knowledge, survival, and decision-making, the game creates a thoughtful environment for players to engage with nature and medicine in meaningful ways.

# Project Deployment
# Medicinal Herb Collection base map
This scene represents a 500×500-meter base terrain for the Medicinal Herb Collection game.The landscape features soft rolling hills and natural elevation changes, forming a realistic environment for exploration and herb gathering.

# Environment Detailing
# Tree Layer (Primary Vegetation)
We have added a consistent forest canopy using low-poly conifer models, which keeps performance high while maintaining visual depth.
# Distribution
Trees are more concentrated in valleys and mid-slopes, leaving the path network semi-clear to guide the player.
# Color Palette 
Deep green foliage with darker trunks enhances the forest depth and contrasts nicely with lighter soil paths.

# Results:
If the user gets lost in a direction then the black cube kill the patient by force. Once the either turns bright green or dies, a new patient spawns with a randomized target.
